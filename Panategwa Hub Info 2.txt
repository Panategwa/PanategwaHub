PROJECT NAME:
Panategwa Hub
-
PURPOSE:
The Panategwa Hub is a fictional worldbuilding website centered around the alien planet Panategwa d and its civilizations, races, languages, maps, and political systems. It serves as a hub for exploring a custom sci-fi universe created by me (the user). The goal is to organize all the lore about Shlank III and other parts of the Shlank star system into a professional-looking, functional, and interactive website.
-
MAIN FOCUS:

Panategwa d: A diverse planet with continents, empires, and unique species

Worldbuilding: Civilizations, cultures, wars, alliances, technology, and geography

Maps: Interactive map pages showing the political layout, tectonic plates, etc.

Nation Pages: Each major nation has its own webpage with structured info
-
MY SKILL LEVEL (IMPORTANT):
I do not know much about coding yet, especially JavaScript and CSS positioning. I'm learning as I build this project. I can copy, paste, and slightly modify code, but I often need help writing or fixing full sections.
-
TECHNOLOGIES USED:

HTML: Basic page layout and content

CSS: Styling (in styles.css and map-styles.css)

JavaScript: menu-loader.js (used to insert the menu)

Hosting: GitHub Pages

Editor: Visual Studio Code
-
FILE STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:

index.html — homepage

styles.css — used on all pages except maps

map-styles.css — used only for map pages, for positioning buttons and dark background

menu-loader.js — JavaScript that loads the site’s top menu into every page

panategwa-d-map.jpg — main map image of Panategwa d

pitosian-empire-page.html — nation profile for Empire of Pitosia

Other nation pages — each nation will have its own HTML page (e.g.: empire-of-pitosia-page.html)
-
MENU SYSTEM:

The menu is dynamically added to every page using a <div id="menu-container">

The menu-loader.js script inserts HTML for the menu from a shared template

The menu links to:

Home
The shlank celestial bodies (shlank (star) shlank i, shlank ii, etc)

MAP PAGES (e.g., shlank3-map.html):

Use map-styles.css (not styles.css)

Background is dark (near black)

Contains an <img> tag for the map (resized to match tectonic map size)

Nation buttons are placed with absolute positioning (top/left in %)

Buttons are spaced using <br> tags

When clicked, buttons open nation pages (e.g., panategwa-empire-page.html)

Example map image: shlank3-political.jpg
-
NATION PAGES (e.g., Pitosian Empire):

Use styles.css for layout

Consistent structure per nation page:

Overview

Government

Geography

People & Society

Economy

Military

Culture

Education

Healthcare

Foreign Relations

Origins

Each section uses <h2> or <h3> with bullet points or paragraphs

Pages can include relevant images (concept art, aliens, maps, etc.)

STYLE NOTES:

Font: Rubik (via Google Fonts)

General CSS in styles.css includes text centering, colors, layout, etc.

map-styles.css is used only for positioning elements over maps and dark background

Map buttons are spaced vertically using <br>
