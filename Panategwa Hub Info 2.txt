üìõ PROJECT NAME:
Shlank Hub

üìå PURPOSE:
Shlank Hub is a fictional worldbuilding website centered around the alien planet Shlank III and its civilizations, races, languages, maps, and political systems. It serves as a hub for exploring a custom sci-fi universe created by me (the user). The goal is to organize all the lore about Shlank III and other parts of the Shlank star system into a professional-looking, functional, and interactive website.

üåç MAIN FOCUS:

Shlank III: A diverse planet with continents, empires, and unique species

Worldbuilding: Civilizations, cultures, wars, alliances, technology, and geography

Maps: Interactive map pages showing the political layout, tectonic plates, etc.

Nation Pages: Each major nation has its own webpage with structured info

MY SKILL LEVEL (IMPORTANT):
I do not know much about coding yet, especially JavaScript and CSS positioning. I'm learning as I build this project. I can copy, paste, and slightly modify code, but I often need help writing or fixing full sections.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

HTML: Basic page layout and content

CSS: Styling (in styles.css and map-styles.css)

JavaScript: menu-loader.js (used to insert the menu)

Hosting: GitHub Pages

Editor: Visual Studio Code

FILE STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:

index.html ‚Äî homepage

styles.css ‚Äî used on all pages except maps

map-styles.css ‚Äî used only for map pages, for positioning buttons and dark background

menu-loader.js ‚Äî JavaScript that loads the site‚Äôs top menu into every page

shlank3-map.html ‚Äî main map page of Shlank III

tectonic-map.html ‚Äî tectonic reference map, used for scaling and design

pitosian-empire-page.html ‚Äî nation profile for Empire of Pitosia

Other nation pages ‚Äî each nation will have its own HTML page

MENU SYSTEM (TOP NAVIGATION):

The menu is dynamically added to every page using a <div id="menu-container">

The menu-loader.js script inserts HTML for the menu from a shared template

The menu links to:

Home
The shlank celestial bodies (shlank (star) shlank i, shlank ii, etc)

üó∫ MAP PAGES (e.g., shlank3-map.html):

Use map-styles.css (not styles.css)

Background is dark (near black)

Contains an <img> tag for the map (resized to match tectonic map size)

Nation buttons are placed with absolute positioning (top/left in %)

Buttons are spaced using <br> tags

When clicked, buttons open nation pages (e.g., panategwa-empire-page.html)

Example map image: shlank3-political.jpg

üìñ NATION PAGES (e.g., Pitosian Empire):

Use styles.css for layout

Consistent structure per nation page:

Overview

Government

Geography

People & Society

Foreign Relations

Origins

Each section uses <h2> or <h3> with bullet points or paragraphs

Pages can include relevant images (concept art, aliens, maps, etc.)
